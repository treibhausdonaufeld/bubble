# Two-Step Item Creation with Background Processing

## Overview

This implementation introduces a two-step item creation process with background image processing and real-time notifications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Two-Step Creation Process
- **Step 1**: Upload images (optional)
- **Step 2**: Edit item details with AI-suggested content

### 2. Background Processing
- Dummy AI image processing task using Celery
- Simulates 2-5 seconds processing time
- Generates suggested title and description
- Handles processing failures gracefully

### 3. Processing States
- `DRAFT`: Newly created item, no processing started
- `PROCESSING`: Background task is analyzing images
- `COMPLETED`: Processing finished, suggestions available
- `FAILED`: Processing encountered an error

### 4. User Experience
- Non-blocking: Users can continue using the app while processing
- Real-time status updates via JavaScript polling
- Option to skip image upload
- Ability to edit suggestions before finalizing

## Files Created/Modified

### Models (`bubble/items/models.py`)
- Added `ProcessingStatus` choices
- Added `processing_status` field to `Item`
- Made `name` field optional (blank=True)
- Added `is_ready_for_display()` method

### Background Tasks (`bubble/items/tasks.py`)
- `process_item_images()`: Dummy image processing task
- Generates realistic suggestions based on image count
- Includes error handling and retry logic
- Placeholder for WebSocket notifications

### Views (`bubble/items/views_step.py`)
- `ItemCreateStepOneView`: Image upload interface
- `ItemCreateStepTwoView`: Details editing with AI suggestions
- `check_processing_status`: AJAX endpoint for status updates
- `skip_image_upload`: Direct to step 2
- `delete_draft_item`: Clean up draft items
- `DraftItemsView`: Manage incomplete items

### Forms (`bubble/items/forms_step.py`)
- `ItemImageUploadForm`: File upload form
- `ItemDetailsForm`: Item details with dynamic categories

### Templates
- `item_create_step1.html`: Image upload interface
- `item_create_step2.html`: Details form with live updates
- `draft_items.html`: Draft item management

### URLs (`bubble/items/urls.py`)
- `/create/` → Step 1 (image upload)
- `/create/step2/<id>/` → Step 2 (details)
- `/create/skip-images/` → Skip to step 2
- `/drafts/` → View draft items
- `/processing-status/<id>/` → AJAX status check

### Navigation Updates
- Added "My Items" dropdown menu
- Includes "Create Item", "My Items", "Drafts"

## User Flow

1. **Start Creation**: User clicks "Create Item" → Step 1
2. **Upload Images** (Optional):
   - Select multiple images
   - Preview selected files
   - Submit to start processing
   - OR skip to manual entry
3. **Background Processing**:
   - Images uploaded to temporary item
   - Celery task processes images (2-5s simulation)
   - Status: "Processing" with spinner
4. **Step 2 - Details**:
   - Form loads immediately (non-blocking)
   - AI suggestions populate automatically when ready
   - User can edit all fields
   - Select category, set price, etc.
   - Submit to complete creation

## Technical Features

### Processing States
```python
class ProcessingStatus(models.IntegerChoices):
    DRAFT = 0, _("Draft")
    PROCESSING = 1, _("Processing")
    COMPLETED = 2, _("Completed")
    FAILED = 3, _("Failed")
```

### Background Task
```python
@shared_task(bind=True)
def process_item_images(self, item_id: int):
    # Simulates AI processing
    # Updates item with suggestions
    # Handles retries on failure
```

### Real-time Updates
- JavaScript polls `/processing-status/<id>/` every 2 seconds
- Updates form fields when processing completes
- Shows success/error notifications
- Highlights AI-suggested content

## Draft Management
- Items in DRAFT/PROCESSING states shown in "Drafts"
- Users can continue editing or delete drafts
- Processing status clearly indicated
- Non-blocking workflow

## Future Enhancements

### Real AI Integration
Replace dummy processing with actual AI services:
```python
# Example integrations:
# - OpenAI Vision API for image analysis
# - Azure Computer Vision for OCR
# - Google Cloud Vision for object detection
```

### WebSocket Notifications
Implement Django Channels for real-time updates:
```python
# Send notification when processing completes
await self.channel_layer.group_send(
    f"user_{user_id}",
    {
        "type": "processing_complete",
        "item_id": item_id,
        "suggestions": suggested_data
    }
)
```

### Enhanced Suggestions
- Category auto-detection from images
- Price estimation based on similar items
- Quality assessment and condition detection
- Multi-language support

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Login as admin (admin/admin123)
3. Navigate to "Create Item"
4. Test both flows:
   - With image upload
   - Skip image upload
5. Verify processing status updates
6. Check draft items management

### Celery Worker
For background processing to work:
```bash
# Start Celery worker
celery -A config.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery beat (for scheduled tasks)
celery -A config.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```

## Database Migration
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations items
python manage.py migrate
```

This adds the `processing_status` field and makes `name` optional.

## Benefits

1. **Non-blocking UX**: Users aren't stuck waiting for processing
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Works without AI suggestions
3. **Flexible Workflow**: Can skip image upload entirely
4. **Error Resilience**: Handles processing failures gracefully
5. **Draft Management**: No lost work, can resume later
6. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see progress and completion
7. **Mobile Friendly**: Works on all device sizes
8. **Extensible**: Easy to add real AI services later
